Twitter played an increasingly prominent role in the 2016 US Presidential Election. Debates had raged and candidates had risen and fallen based on tweets. 

[This](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/clinton-trump-tweets/home) dataset provides ~6000 recent tweets from Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, the two major-party presidential nominees.

Our goal is to develop a model which determines the author of a given tweet.

To do so, we're using the Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier. You can read more about it [here](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/multinomial-naive-bayes-explained/).
